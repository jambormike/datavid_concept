Assessment: The patient presents with headaches and blurred vision that have persisted for a week, despite trying over-the-counter pain medication. Given the persistent nature of the symptoms and the patient's young age, it is important to rule out any potentially serious underlying causes. A thorough investigation is necessary to determine the cause of these symptoms.

Plan:

1. Order an MRI of the brain and orbit to evaluate for intracranial or orbital pathology.
2. Perform a comprehensive eye examination to assess visual acuity, refraction, and fundoscopy.
3. Consider referral to a neurologist or ophthalmologist for further evaluation and management.
4. Provide the patient with a list of high-risk symptoms to monitor and instruct them to return to the clinic immediately if they experience any worsening of symptoms.
5. Schedule follow-up appointment in 1-2 weeks to review results of investigations and reassess the patient's condition.
