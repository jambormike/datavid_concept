 Introduction by Steve Jones. Science, in the public mind, is detached from the people who practice it. Everyone knows about viruses or the background radiation of a big bank, but almost nobody could name the individuals who discovered them. DNA is different and this book is the reason why. From its first sentence, I have never seen Francis Crick in a modest mood. It combines the facts of science with the wrestling, not to say, raffish, tale of how they were unveiled. Rereading it, in my case, after nearly 30 years, is to affirm the genius of those who did the job. It is also a reminder of how much science and scientists have changed in the decades since Watson Crick, 1953, the paper that began modern genetics.
